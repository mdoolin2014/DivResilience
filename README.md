## Experimental approach
Mice with a phylogenetically diverse low richness microbiota of 11 bacteria (named "PhyLo11B" community) and typical SPF mice were challenged with infection by the small intestinal roundworm Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri. The fecal microbiota was sampled and characterized by _16S rRNA_ gene sequencing at 7 timepoints over a six-week experiment that included a round of infection and clearance. Sham-treated mice of both microbiome types were run alongside those that were experimentally infected. To examine stability, we include analyses of change over the course of 7 timepoints. To examine resilience (i.e., ability to recover back to the starting state), we include analyses comparing pretreatment samples to samples at the final timepoint of the experiment. 

## Significance
We contribute a new approach to investigating the relationship of ecosystem diversity with stability and resilience by using a synthetic, representative gut microbiota paired with a typical community that share some of the same bacterial strains. This approach was made more similar to real-world risks of low diversity gut microbiota because mice with the synthetic gut community were housed in the same conditions as SPF mice, exposed to environmental microbes. Also, the PhyLo11B mouse lineage is a novel contribution to scientific research and is available for other researchers. 

## Documentation and files
This repository includes code (R and shell scripts) associated with all analyses used for data in the manuscript. We also include the phyloseq object that we produced from the cleaned and processing _16S rRNA_ data and metadata files to go along with analyses of 16S data and body mass.
